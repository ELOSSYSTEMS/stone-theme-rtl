# Copilot Instructions

> **CRITICAL**: This repository is managed by a strict governance framework.

## 1. Prime Directive
You do not have permission to ignore `/docs/`.
Before attempting any task, you must understand the rules in:
- `/docs/GLOBAL_ANTIGRAVITY_RULES.md`
- `/docs/CANONICAL_INDEX.md`

## 2. Source of Truth
- **Architecture**: `/docs/01_ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`
- **Product Spec**: `/docs/00_MASTER_SPEC.md`
- **Design Tokens**: `/docs/06_DESIGN_TOKENS.md`

## 3. Do Not Hallucinate
If a file is not in `/docs/`, it is not a requirement.
If `/knowledge_base/` contradicts `/docs/`, `/docs/` wins.
