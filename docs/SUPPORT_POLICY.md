# SUPPORT_POLICY — Customer Support Boundary (Theme)
Version: 0.1  
Price: ₪1,250  
Purpose: Define exactly what buyers get, what they do not get, and how support is handled.

## 0) Summary (Public-Facing)
- Includes: theme updates + bug fixes and support for theme defects.
- Excludes: custom development, design services, third-party app troubleshooting beyond documented compatibility.

## 1) Definitions
### 1.1 “Theme Defect” (Covered)
A reproducible issue caused by the theme code, such as:
- RTL layout breaking in shipped templates
- Missing translations for shipped UI
- Accessibility regressions in shipped components
- Cart/PDP critical flow bugs (add to cart, variant selection, drawer)
- CSS/JS errors introduced by theme updates

### 1.2 “Customization Request” (Not Covered)
Requests such as:
- Changing layouts beyond settings
- Building new sections not included in scope
- Custom design work (branding, typography, bespoke spacing systems)
- Adding new integrations, tracking, pixels
- App configuration, app CSS fixes (unless explicitly included in compatibility notes)

### 1.3 “Third-Party Conflict” (Usually Not Covered)
If an app or custom code snippet breaks the theme:
- We can identify likely cause, but full fixes are not included.
- If the conflict is with an app listed as ✅ Compatible and the theme is at fault, it becomes a Theme Defect.

## 2) Support Window
Minimum policy (recommended):
- **30 days support** from purchase date for Theme Defects.
- Support channel: email/ticket (define actual channel outside this doc later).
- Response time target: 2–3 business days (do not guarantee faster unless you can deliver).

Optional upsell policy (if desired later):
- Paid support plans for extended periods
- Paid “setup assistance” package

## 3) What We Need From Customers to Help
To qualify for support, customer must provide:
- Store URL
- Theme version number
- Steps to reproduce
- Screenshots or short screen recording
- List of installed apps
- Confirmation whether custom code was added

Without this, support is delayed or rejected.

## 4) Update Policy
### 4.1 Included Updates
- Bug-fix releases (patch versions) during the support window.
- Compatibility fixes for Shopify platform changes when feasible.

### 4.2 Breaking Changes
- Avoid breaking schema/settings.
- If a breaking change is unavoidable:
  - It must be documented with migration steps.
  - It should be a major version bump.

### 4.3 Delivery of Updates
- Theme Store customers: updates via Shopify Theme Store mechanism.
- Private-sale customers (if applicable): provide a download/update channel and instructions.

## 5) Support Exclusions (Explicit)
Not included:
- Custom section development
- Custom page redesigns
- Performance audits for app-heavy stores
- Converting content or writing marketing copy
- SEO strategy
- Ads, analytics setup, pixels
- Checkout customization beyond theme control

## 6) Refund / Cancellation (Policy Placeholder)
Define later based on sales channel:
- Theme Store: governed by Shopify’s policies.
- Private sale: define your own terms.

This doc must be updated once the sales channel is finalized.

## 7) Scope Guardrails (Protect the Product)
If a request:
- increases global JS weight significantly,
- introduces non-RTL-safe UI patterns,
- or breaks Theme Store guidelines,
then the answer is “no” unless approved as a paid custom project.
