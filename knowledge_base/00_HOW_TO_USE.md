# How To Use The Knowledge Base

## Purpose
This directory contains research, reference materials, and "packs" of knowledge from other sources. 
It is a library, not a rulebook.

## The "Advisory" Rule
Nothing in `/knowledge_base/` is binding on the project build unless it has been explicitly imported into a document in `/docs/`.
If you find a conflict between `/knowledge_base/` and `/docs/`, `/docs/` wins.

## When to use
- Use this for inspiration.
- Use this to understand "standard" Shopify patterns.
- Use this to look up how other themes solve problems.
