# Archetype Themes — Open Knowledge Pack (for Theme Engineering)
Generated: 2026-02-07

Purpose:
A structured, markdown-first reference library distilled from **openly available, official Archetype Themes resources** (public GitHub org + public help center + official site pages).  
Designed for IDE/LLM ingestion to support your Shopify theme project (Skeleton-based baseline), especially around:
- component-first workflow patterns
- CLI tooling ideas (Devkit plugin)
- feature expectations (swatches, filtering, media, high-variant products)
- update/upgrade strategy and “avoid divergence” doctrine

This pack contains **summaries and URL inventories** (not mirrored paywalled content).

## Entry point
- `CANONICAL_INDEX.md`
