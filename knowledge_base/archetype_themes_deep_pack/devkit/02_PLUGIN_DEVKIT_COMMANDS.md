# Tooling: plugin-devkit (Shopify CLI plugin)

Repo:
- https://github.com/archetype-themes/plugin-devkit

Purpose:
Adds a component workflow on top of Shopify CLI, including:
- developing components in isolation
- copying/cleaning components into a theme
- generating import maps / template maps
- syncing/cleaning locales

Install (per repo README):
- `shopify plugins install plugin-devkit`

Important:
- There is an older plugin repo (`plugin-theme-component`) that is archived and points to `plugin-devkit` as the replacement.
