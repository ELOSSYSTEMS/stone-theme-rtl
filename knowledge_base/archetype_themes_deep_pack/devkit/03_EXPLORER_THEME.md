# Explorer theme: isolated component dev

Repo:
- https://github.com/archetype-themes/explorer

Idea:
Use a dedicated development theme to create an isolated environment for building/testing components inside the Shopify theme editor.

Transferable application to your project:
- Maintain a separate “lab” theme for experiments.
- Merge components into production theme only after QA.

Anchor:
- Explorer README describes how `shopify theme component dev` bootstraps `.dev` and runs `shopify theme dev` against it.
