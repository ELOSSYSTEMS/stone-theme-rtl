# Reference-components: structure patterns

Repo:
- https://github.com/archetype-themes/reference-components

What it is:
A set of foundational components demonstrating:
- header
- media-with-text
- product page
- cart

Signals worth encoding:
- repo includes a `.theme-check.yml` (lint config)
- repo includes Playwright config files (automated tests)

Also:
- README references a component explorer storefront and provides a password ("archetype") for viewing.

Use:
- Extract naming conventions and file organization patterns.
- Translate patterns into Skeleton-compatible sections/snippets/assets.
