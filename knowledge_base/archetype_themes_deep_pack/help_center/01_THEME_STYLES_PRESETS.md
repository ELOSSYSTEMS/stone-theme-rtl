# Theme styles as presets (settings bundles)

Source:
- Understanding Theme Styles: https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/1231680

Key points to encode:
- “Theme styles” are largely **theme settings presets** (typography, colors, defaults).
- Switching styles later changes settings; it does not necessarily restructure templates.
- Backups recommended because settings can reset.

Transferable spec:
- Implement styles as preset configurations, not structural changes to templates.
