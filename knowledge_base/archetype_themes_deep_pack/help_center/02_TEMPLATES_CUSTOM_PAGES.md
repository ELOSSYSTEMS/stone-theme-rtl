# Templates & custom pages workflow

Source:
- Custom pages with sections (new template): https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/2732

Key points:
- Editing a template affects all pages that use it.
- For exceptions, create a new template and assign it.
- Shopify only lets you assign templates from the published theme, but you can preview changes before publishing.

Transferable spec:
- Treat templates as versioned contracts; create variants rather than one-off edits.
