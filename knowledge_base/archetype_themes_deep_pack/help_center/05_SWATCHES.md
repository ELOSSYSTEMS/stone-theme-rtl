# Swatches approach (Shopify native)

Source:
- Built-in swatches guide: https://help.archetypethemes.co/en/articles/3232128

Key points:
- Uses Shopify’s native swatches (taxonomy/category + category metafields).
- Maps metafields to variant options; then enable swatches in theme settings.

Transferable spec:
- Prefer Shopify-native swatches where possible.
- Build settings-driven mapping rather than hardcoded logic.
