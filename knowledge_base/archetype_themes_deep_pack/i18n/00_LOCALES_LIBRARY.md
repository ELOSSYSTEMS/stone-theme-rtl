# Locales library notes

Repo:
- https://github.com/archetype-themes/locales

What it provides:
- Shared translation keys/strings for commerce concepts.
- A consistent taxonomy of wording across languages.

Important limitation:
- Hebrew is not listed among supported languages in the repo README (you will need to add Hebrew translations yourself).

Use in your project:
- Adopt the key structure as a standard.
- Add `he.json` (or equivalent) translations while keeping keys consistent across languages.
