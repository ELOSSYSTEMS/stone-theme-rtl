Key operational reality:
- Updates become expensive when your code diverges from upstream patterns.
- There is no automatic “merge to latest” once you heavily modify theme code.

Transferable doctrine:
- Isolate customizations.
- Prefer platform-native features.
- Keep changes small and well-documented.
