# Repo license inventory (manual-check checklist)

Because licenses can change, treat this as a checklist to verify before reusing code:
- Open each repo’s `LICENSE` or `LICENSE.md`.
- Record:
  - SPDX identifier (if present)
  - Any additional restrictions or trademark notes
  - Whether it is permissive (MIT/Apache-2.0) or copyleft (GPL, etc.)
