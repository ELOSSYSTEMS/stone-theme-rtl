# Shopify scope: Skeleton-first (not Dawn)

Focus:
- Shopify CLI theme workflow using `shopify theme init` (Skeleton theme default)
- Online Store 2.0 architecture (layouts/templates/sections/blocks/settings)
- Theme editor integration
- Locales/i18n (for Hebrew + RTL)
- Tooling: Theme Check, Theme Inspector, environments, language server

Exclusions:
- Dawn-specific implementation patterns unless they are generic OS2 concepts.
