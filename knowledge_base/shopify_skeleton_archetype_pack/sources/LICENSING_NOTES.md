# Licensing and usage notes (high-level)

This pack contains:
- Summaries written by the assistant
- URL maps to official pages and public GitHub repos

It does **not** mirror Shopify Academy course content or copy full pages.

Action item:
- Before bulk scraping or automated mirroring, review the relevant Terms of Service / acceptable use for:
  - shopify.dev
  - shopifyacademy.com
  - github.com (repo licenses vary per repository)
  - archetypethemes.co

If you want, we can add a dedicated `TERMS_AND_LIMITS.md` once you supply the exact policy URLs you want enforced.
