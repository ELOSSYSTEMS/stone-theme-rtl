# Update-watch plan (what to monitor)

## Shopify (high change likelihood)
- Shopify CLI theme init/dev/check docs
- Theme architecture: templates/sections/blocks/settings/locales
- Theme Check docs + checks reference
- Theme store requirements
- Shopify changelog entries for themes/CLI

Practical approach:
- Weekly check the above URLs for significant changes.
- Track the Skeleton theme repo releases/commits.

## Archetype (medium change likelihood)
- Devkit repo (docs structure + workflows)
- plugin-devkit repo (commands/compatibility)
- locales repo (strings/structure updates)

Practical approach:
- Watch repos (GitHub notifications) + review release notes monthly.
