# Clean Canvas — updating philosophy

## “Updates are not supported” message (Verified)
Clean Canvas states:
- Shopify can update only themes installed from the Theme Store, not uploaded ZIPs.
- If obtained outside Shopify, a purchase is required to download updates; they do not sell outside the Theme Store.

## Update app positioning (Verified)
They reference Out of the Sandbox Theme Updater Plus app as an option to preserve content/customizations across updates.

## Extraction (Inference)
- Treat licensing + install source as a first-class operational constraint.
- For STONE: ensure distribution method preserves update eligibility and avoids “ZIP drift.”
