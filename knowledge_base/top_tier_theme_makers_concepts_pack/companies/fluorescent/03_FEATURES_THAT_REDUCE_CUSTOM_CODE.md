## Extraction (Inference)
Top themes often:
- provide controlled extension points
- keep customization inside editor settings
- only expose code-level customization through safe, bounded mechanisms

## Apply to STONE RTL
Implement:
- a safe Custom Liquid section
- bounded Custom CSS settings (avoid global breakage)
- documented event hooks for integrations
