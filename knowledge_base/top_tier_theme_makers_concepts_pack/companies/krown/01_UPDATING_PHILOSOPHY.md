# Krown Themes — update doctrine + “changelog discipline”

## Verified statements
- Themes are updated frequently to fix bugs, add features, and adapt to Shopify platform changes.
- Custom changes in original code are not copied into the updated theme; you can manually transfer, but you need to keep a changelog of edits.
- They reference Shopify’s official updating-themes documentation as canonical.

## Extraction (Inference)
- Changelog discipline is not optional: it is the only way to reapply customizations safely.
- For STONE: implement a mandatory `CUSTOMIZATIONS_CHANGELOG.md` gate.
