## Manual update reality (Verified)
- Shopify duplicates a new version; content/templates copy, but custom code must be re-applied manually.
- Support team does not assist with transferring custom code.

## Extraction (Inference)
- Your “custom layer” must be re-playable.
- Maintain a changelog of code edits and prefer settings-first customizations.
