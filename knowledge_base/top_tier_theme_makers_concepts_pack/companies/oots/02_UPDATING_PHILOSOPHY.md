# OOTS — updating philosophy (manual vs tools)

## Manual update reality (Verified)
OOTS describes manual updating as:
1) retrieve newest theme version
2) transfer content/settings
3) publish new version

They state:
- You cannot switch automatically without losing customizations when doing the manual method; custom edits must be reproduced manually.

## Tooling philosophy (Verified)
OOTS positions Theme Updater as adding migration support beyond Shopify’s built-in updater, including code edits and schema changes.

They note some files still require manual resolution through a conflicts UI.

## Extraction (Inference)
- “Updater tools” reduce labor but do not eliminate human judgment.
- Build STONE with an “upgrade migration path”: settings-first customization + isolated code layer.
