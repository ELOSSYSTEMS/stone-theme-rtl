# Switch Themes — support boundaries and what they value

## Support scope (Verified)
- General questions about features/functionality
- Help setting up and configuring theme settings
- Fixing bugs discovered during setup (aim to fix immediately)

## Explicit exclusions (Verified)
- Custom coding requests (HTML/CSS/Liquid)
- Installing third-party plugins/apps
- Upgrading themes or older themes to add features from newer versions
- Providing raw uncompiled source (they suggest using un-minified theme.css/theme.js)

## Extraction (Inference)
- They design themes so most merchant needs are met through settings.
- They optimize support load by narrowing scope to the standard install path.
