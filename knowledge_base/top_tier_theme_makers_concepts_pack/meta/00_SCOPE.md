# Scope

This pack focuses on **how top theme makers think** and what constraints they enforce publicly:
- Updateability and how custom code complicates upgrades
- Support boundaries (what theme vendors will and won't support)
- App risk (apps that inject code)
- Performance and accessibility as baseline quality
- Vendor-grade workflow discipline (small diffs, backups, QA, rollbacks)

Not included:
- Proprietary build systems or private repositories
- Non-official third-party guides
- Long verbatim copies of documentation
