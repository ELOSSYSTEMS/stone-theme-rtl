# We Make Websites (WMW) — Research Pack (Public Sources)

Created: 2026-02-07 (Asia/Jerusalem)

Scope: Publicly available information about **We Make Websites** (wemakewebsites.com) that is useful for Shopify theme work, architecture decisions, and process design.
Note: WMW publicly states it is transitioning into **BORN** (Tech Mahindra) and may close the WMW brand. See sources.

## How to use this pack (IDE/LLM)
1. Treat this as *reference material* and *process inspiration* — not a blueprint to copy proprietary frameworks.
2. Use the **Prompt Library** to guide your IDE step-by-step (planning → small diffs → QA).
3. When a file here says **Verified**, it is directly stated in a cited source.
4. When a file says **Inference**, it is a reasonable takeaway from multiple Verified statements.
