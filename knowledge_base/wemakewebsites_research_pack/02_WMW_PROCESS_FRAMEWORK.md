## “How we approach website development” (public stages)
- Verified: Discovery — in-depth workshops to understand goals and choose approach.
- Verified: Design + Development — design/dev collaborate to ensure feasibility before build; then build bespoke Shopify theme.
- Verified: Quality Assurance — QA throughout development.
- Verified: Post Launch Support — support through launch.

## Operational takeaways you can reuse (for a solo build)
- Inference: Convert the 4 stages into a repeating loop per milestone:
  1) Discovery (spec)
  2) Design/Dev (implementation)
  3) QA (verification)
  4) Post-launch support (stabilize, monitor, iterate)

## Minimal “agency-grade” deliverables per stage (solo friendly)
- Discovery:
  - Single-page brief: goals, constraints, pages, required sections, i18n/RTL requirements, performance budget.
- Design/Dev:
  - Section inventory + schema decisions
  - Component naming conventions + file map
  - Small diffs in a controlled order
- QA:
  - Regression matrix (cart/checkout/search/i18n/rtl)
  - Lighthouse + real-device pass
- Post-launch:
  - Bug triage, logging, and a weekly improvements backlog
