# WMW “Theme System / Custom Framework” (Public Notes)

Source page: https://www.wemakewebsites.com/services/shopify-plus-web-development

## What they publicly claim
- Verified: They describe a “bespoke custom framework” and state:
  “Our theme system for Shopify is an accelerator for creating bespoke themes that are optimized for speed and performance.”

## What you can safely infer (without copying anything proprietary)
- Inference: Their “theme system” likely includes:
  - Standardized section/component patterns
  - Repeatable schemas and naming conventions
  - A performance-first baseline and QA gates
  - A library of reusable UX patterns

## How to emulate the *outcome* (not the proprietary code)
- Build your own “accelerator” artifacts:
  1) A canonical section library (hero, collection grid, product media, trust, FAQ, etc.)
  2) A schema playbook (common settings blocks, i18n text strategy)
  3) A performance budget + defaults (image sizes, lazy-loading policy)
  4) QA matrix + regression checklist
  5) A decision log file (why each architecture choice was made)
