## Extractable theme-building signals
- Inference:
  - Performance and accessibility are treated as first-class services (not add-ons).
  - Internationalization is common in enterprise builds and must be planned early.
  - Search (Algolia/Klevu) and compliance (OneTrust) frequently appear; design your theme to accommodate them without heavy coupling.
